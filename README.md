If you’re looking for a practical, idiomatic way to learn the basics of the Go programming language, this course has your name written all over it—plus, it’s so simple and easy to use. Instructor Johnny Boursiquot shows you the building blocks of working directly with the Go command line and exploring the core features of its syntax to extend your workflow. Get an in-depth introduction to the key concepts you need to know to start writing professional-grade code in Go on your own, with tips on how to work with packages, primitive and composite types, flow control, interfaces, and goroutines. Along the way, learn how to tap into the Go toolchain to compile and test your code as you go, leveraging the power of concurrency synchronization using channels to communicate data between multiple goroutines at the same time.<br><br>The best way to learn a language is to use it in practice. That’s why this course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the [Using GitHub Codespaces with this course][gcs-video-url] video to learn how to get started.


## Instructions
This repository has all of the examples presented in the videos layed out in the `main` branch. As each video is presented, the examples on screen will indicate which folder/file is being worked on so you can follow along.

Folders named `begin` under each topic folder represent the starting point on screen during the videos. Folders named `end` are the complete solutions and examples that you can use to compare with your own solutions or to use as reference.

## Working with Codespaces

We encourage you to make use of GitHub Codespaces to code along with the instructor. Simply clone the repository into your own account and launch Codespaces within that repository. This will allow you to make and commit changes to your own copy of the exercises and examples.
